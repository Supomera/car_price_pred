# 🚗💰 Car Price Prophet 🔥  

**Can we predict the price of your dream car?** Maybe. **Can we make your dream car affordable?** Probably not.  

## 🧠 What's This About?  
This project takes **machine learning & deep learning** for a spin 🏎️ to predict car prices based on **25+ features**. I tried **Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and even Neural Networks**—because why not? Turns out, **Random Forest** wins the race! 🏆  

## 🔍 What I Did:  
- **Feature Engineering**: Because raw data is like a car without fuel. ⛽  
- **Model Training**: Tried everything from **Linear Regression** to **Deep Learning**, but some models stalled. 🚨  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tweaked dials like a car mechanic. 🔧  
- **Comparison & Analysis**: Because data science without stats is just guessing. 🎲  
- **Fought Multicollinearity**: Detected multicollinearity, tried to deal with that.

## 📈 Results  
- **Random Forest & Gradient Boosting** crushed it. 🏁  
- **Linear Regression tried its best.** Bless its heart. ❤️  
- **Neural Networks... well, let’s just say it needs a pit stop.** ⛽  
- **Multicollinearity?** Instead of dealing with the data with using some methods, I selected models which will not be affected from multicollinearity directly. 


## 🛠️ Future Work  
- Spend more time on the hyperparameters of the deep learning solution if needed. Since the machine learning solution was sufficient, I didn’t allocate my time to deep learning.
- Expanding the dataset for a more accurately distributed selection of car brands.
